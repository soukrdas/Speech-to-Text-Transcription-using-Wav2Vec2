# Speech-to-Text-Transcription-using-Wav2Vec2
This project uses Python and Facebookâ€™s Wav2Vec2 model to transcribe audio files into text. By uploading a WAV file, the code processes the audio and generates accurate text output, making it a simple example of speech-to-text using machine learning and natural language processing.
